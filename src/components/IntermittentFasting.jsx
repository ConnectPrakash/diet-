            <p>
                Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating. It doesn't specify which foods to eat, but rather when to eat them. There are several different methods of intermittent fasting, ranging from daily fasting periods to fasting for 24 hours or more on certain days.
